## Before Production

Before deploying playbooks in production, conduct thorough testing. Production systems encounter challenges not seen in lab setups. Test these critical areas:

- **Error Cases**: Do playbooks handle failures gracefully?
- **Idempotency**: Do repeated runs produce consistent results?
- **Scale**: Does performance hold at production scale?
- **Resource Usage**: Are memory and CPU footprints acceptable?

Thorough testing minimizes production risks and ensures reliability.

## Reporting Issues
